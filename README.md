# Activity Client

This repo contains the activity clients. There are two versions of the clients, console-based and gui-based.

### Console based client

This is kept under folder v1. This is a simple python application which just runs in the client machine on start-up. This is currently in production. It is built up incrementally, and there are lots of scope for improvements. In fact, we are getting different requirements while it is being actively used.

### GUI based client

This is kept under folder v2. This is an improved GUI version of the client based on the nodejs electron based client. The choice of electron is because, it is based on node and we just need to have a web application ready which can be wrapped in the electron as a gui-based application. This is under development currently.
